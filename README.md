# Monet2Photo
Here is my project on GANs. The task was to learn, using a generative-adversarial model, to learn from Monet's paintings to create a real image of what was depicted in the painting, and to make real paintings look like Monet's paintings.

Here is the Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balraj98/monet2photo

You can laung this notebook on Kaggle and attach the dataset there as well.
